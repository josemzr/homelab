# homelab

This is ikeacluster, my take on using an IKEA HELMER filing cabinet and
turning it into a nearly silent, low power, rig for a home lab.  It supports
up to 10x mini-ITX motherboards, a mixture of 20x 2.5" or 3.5" hard drives
and/or SSDs, all running on a single ATX power supply.  Best of all, it fits
under a desk!

I first built this in 2012 and various bits have changed and expanded over
time, nevertheless it's been running nonstop 24/7 for over six years now!

Over time I hope to put together a bill of materials and halfway decent
construction doc here so people can build their own if they want.  I'm not
sure why I published this on Github instead of my own website, I guess to
be trendy.

There's room for quite a bit of improvisation and loose workmanship in
building this. Even if I built another one, it probably wouldn't be exactly
like this one.

In the meantime I've got my hands on a laser cutter and designed a file for
the acrylic "boards" or "blades" that each motherboard and hard drive(s) mount
to.  They can absolutely be cut and drilled by hand but I found the work
tedious and time consuming to do a neat job.
See the Files section below or go browse through the `laser/` directory.
