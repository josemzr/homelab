# homelab

This is ikeacluster, my take on using an IKEA HELMER filing cabinet and
turning it into a nearly silent, low power, rig for a home lab.  It supports
up to 10x mini-ITX motherboards, a mixture of 20x 2.5" or 3.5" hard drives
and/or SSDs, all running on a single ATX power supply.

Over time I hope to put together a bill of materials and halfway decent
construction doc so people can build their own if they want.

In the meantime I've got my hands on a laser cutter and designed a file for
the acrylic "boards" or "blades" that each motherboard and hard drive(s) mount
to.  They can absolutely be cut and drilled by hand but I found the work
tedious and time consuming to do a neat job.
See the Files section below or go browse through the `laser/` directory.
